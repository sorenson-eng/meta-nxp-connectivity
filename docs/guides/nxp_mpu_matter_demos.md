The commissioning process consists of the following main stages:

- Setup OTBR on i.MX MPU platform
- Configure OpenThread Network
- Factory reset lighting application on K32W DK6
- Commission the lighting-app on the i.MX controller
- Control the lighting-app on the i.MX controller

### Setup OTBR on i.MX MPU platform

To set up OTBR on the i.MX MPU platform, you need to do three steps:

step1. Save the Wi-Fi SSID and password to a file.

    $ wpa_passphrase ${SSID} ${PASSWORD} > wifiap.conf

Step2. Connecting to the Wi-Fi AP, Enabling BT, and Setting Up OTBR on the i.MX MPU Platform.

The i.MX6ULL OTBR setup commands are same with the i.MX8M Mini commands.

*Note: If "$ ifconfig wpan0" can find the wpan0 as shown below, the otbr-agent was successfully set up.*

    $ ifconfig wpan0
    wpan0: flags=4240<POINTOPOINT,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1280
    unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 500  (UNSPEC)

    TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
    TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

### Configure OpenThread Network

<a name="start-thread"></a>

You can form the Openthread network manually by following steps:

    $ ot-ctl dataset init new
    $ ot-ctl dataset commit active
    $ ot-ctl ifconfig up
    $ ot-ctl thread start

Then, you should get thread network credentials information.

    $ ot-ctl dataset active -x
    # Then you will get a dataset like "0e080000000000010000000300001035060004001fffe00208d625374d9c65c2a30708fd57eb72a74fa52505108a177ca3b66becf3bbe2149eb3d135c8030f4f70656e5468726561642d656338350102ec85041044ac05395e78940b72c1df1e6ad02a120c0402a0f7f8"

***Note: please use the ot-ctl-iwxxx-spi instead of ot-ctl on i.MX93 and use the ot-ctl-iw610-spi on i.MX91 device.***

### Factory reset lighting application on K32W DK6

Step1. Press the SW2 button on OM15802, after 6 seconds, the device will reset its persistent configuration and initiate a reboot.

Step2. Toggle reset.

Step3. Press the USERINTERFACE button to start the BLE Advertising, which is mandatory for device commissioning.

### Commission the lighting-app on the i.MX controller

Commissioning command as below.

    # ble-thread pairing
    $ chip-tool pairing ble-thread 8888 hex:0e080000000000010000000300001035060004001fffe00208d625374d9c65c2a30708fd57eb72a74fa52505108a177ca3b66becf3bbe2149eb3d135c8030f4f70656e5468726561642d656338350102ec85041044ac05395e78940b72c1df1e6ad02a120c0402a0f7f8 20202021 3840

The parameter after "ble-thread" is node-id (here it is 8888, it can be any positive integer starting from 1) that should be set uniquely for each Matter device that joined the network, the last but one parameter is pin code (here it is fixed to 20202021), the last parameter is discriminator (here it is fixed to 3840).

If there is a message **“Device commissioning completed with success”** in the controller log, it means that the Matter device has successfully joined the network.

### Control the lighting-app on the i.MX controller

    # toggle the lighting
    $ chip-tool onoff toggle 8888 1
    # turn on the lighting
    $ chip-tool onoff on 8888 1
    # turn off the lighting
    $ chip-tool onoff off 8888 1

    # read the lighting on-off status
    $ chip-tool onoff read on-off 8888 1

Since chip-tool-trusty can run on the i.MX8M Mini EVK platform, the chip-tool in the above commands can replace chip-tool-trusty. **Note that before running chip-tool-trusty, you should use to the [enable command](#enable-the-secure-storage-service) to enable the secure storage service.**

### Setup ot-daemon on i.MX MPU platform

Please use below commands to setup ot-daemon on an device:

    #load WiFi driver and FW
    $ modprobe moal mod_para=nxp/wifi_mod_para.conf

    #For i.MX8M Mini EVK + 88W8987, i.MX8ULP EVK and i.MX6ULL EVK + 88W8987 with K32W RCP:
    $ ot-daemon 'spinel+hdlc+uart:///dev/ttyUSB0?uart-baudrate=1000000' &

    #For i.MX93 EVK + IW612:
    $ ot-daemon-iwxxx-spi 'spinel+spi:///dev/spidev0.0?gpio-reset-device=/dev/gpiochip4&gpio-int-device=/dev/gpiochip5&gpio-int-line=10&gpio-reset-line=1&spi-mode=0&spi-speed=1000000&spi-reset-delay=0' &

    #For i.MX91 EVK + IW610:
    $ ot-daemon-iw610-spi 'spinel+spi:///dev/spidev0.0?gpio-reset-device=/dev/gpiochip4&gpio-int-device=/dev/gpiochip5&gpio-int-line=10&gpio-reset-line=1&spi-mode=0&spi-speed=1000000&spi-reset-delay=0' &

You can test the ot-daemon with another device running otbr-agent, [start the thread network](#start-thread) on the other device.

Then you can form the Openthread network manually by following steps on the device running ot-daemon:

    $ ot-client-ctl dataset set active 0e080000000000010000000300001735060004001fffe002082dc54ed03afaa5220708fdad8f0074b8f0790510c6d2c28a700176d8cd8e7d49a64395f8030f4f70656e5468726561642d36333130010263100410fed04e9e0912590b8d2d725a6ab33db50c0402a0f7f8
    $ ot-client-ctl ifconfig up
    $ ot-client-ctl thread start

***Note: please use the ot-client-iwxxx-spi instead of ot-client-ctl on i.MX93 and ot-client-iw610-spi on i.MX91 device.***

## Running other Matter demos on i.MX MPU platform

For example applications running on the i.MX MPU platform, you can test the applications using two commissioning methods. These two commissioning methods require the i.MX platform running the chip tool as the controller device and another i.MX platform as the end device.

### Run example applications with ble-wifi commissioning method

The network topology diagram by using ble-wifi commissioning is shown below.

 <img src="../images/matter_demos/ble-wifi.png" width = "500"/>

Figure i.MX network topology diagram for ble-wifi commissioning

The ble-wifi commissioning method requires the controller device needs to setup BT and connect to a Wi-Fi AP, the end device needs to setup BT.

The commissioning process consists of the following main stages:

- Set up BLE and connect to a Wi-Fi AP on the controller device
- Load the Wi-Fi/BT firmware and set up BLE on the end device
- Run the example application on the end device
- Commision and control the end devices on the controller device

#### Set up BT and connect to a wifi AP on controller device

step1. Save Wi-Fi SSID and Password to a file.

    $ wpa_passphrase ${SSID} ${PASSWORD} > wifiap.conf

step2. Setup BT and connectd to a WiFi AP.

For i.MX93 EVK, i.MX8M Mini EVK and i.MX6ULL EVK and i.MX91 EVK:

        、、、
        modprobe moal mod_para=nxp/wifi_mod_para.conf
        wpa_supplicant -d -B -i mlan0 -c ./wifiap.conf
        sleep 5
        modprobe btnxpuart
        hciconfig hci0 up
        、、、

#### Load the Wi-Fi/BT firmware and set up BT on the end device

Load the Wi-Fi/BT firmware and set up BT. For i.MX93 EVK, i.MX8M Mini EVK and i.MX6ULL EVK and i.MX91 EVK:

        、、、
        modprobe moal mod_para=nxp/wifi_mod_para.conf
        sleep 5
        modprobe btnxpuart
        hciconfig hci0 up
        、、、

#### Run the example application on the end device

After setting up the network on both side platforms, run the example application on the end device.

___[ELE](https://www.nxp.com/products/nxp-product-information/nxp-product-programs/edgelock-secure-enclave:EDGELOCK-SECURE-ENCLAVE) has been integrated into i.MX93 EVK since the i.MX Matter 2023 Q3 release, so when you run example applications such as chip-lighting-app, nxp-thermostat-app, etc. on i.MX93 EVK, you need to run "$ systemctl start nvm_daemon" to enable ELE (only need to run once after each power-up), and then run example applications.___

Currently, applications with trusty are supported on the i.MX8M Mini EVK, such as chip-tool-trusty, chip-lighting-app-trusty, nxp-thermostat-app-trusty and nxp-media-app-trusty. Before running these trusty example applications, you must execute the following commands to enable the secure storage service (only need to execute once after initial boot), and the the following commissioning steps are consistent with the above.

<a name="enable-the-secure-storage-service"></a>

    $ systemctl enable storageproxyd
    $ systemctl start storageproxyd

###  Run example applications with onnetwork commissioning method

To test onnetwork, two devices must connect to the same Wi-Fi AP or connect to the same local area network. Taking the case of connecting to the same Wi-Fi AP as an example, the network topology diagram is shown below.

Figure i.MX Network Topology Diagram for Onnetwork Commissioning

First, you must connect the i.MX device acting as the controller device to a Wi-Fi AP using the following commands.

    wpa_passphrase ${SSID} ${PASSWORD} > wifiap.conf

    modprobe moal mod_para=nxp/wifi_mod_para.conf
    wpa_supplicant -d -B -i mlan0 -c ./wifiap.conf
    sleep 5

Then, run example applications on another i.MX device that acts as the end device.

    # to run chip-lighting-app
    $ chip-lighting-app

    # to run chip-all-clusters-app
    $ chip-all-clusters-app

    # to run nxp-thermostat-app
    $ nxp-thermostat-app

    # to run chip-bridge-app
    $ chip-bridge-app

    # to run chip-energy-management-app
    $ chip-energy-management-app

Final, commission and control the end device on the controller device.

    # commission the end devices
    $ chip-tool pairing onnetwork 8888 20202021

    # control commands same as ble-wifi commissioning method

To run applications with trusty on the i.MX8M Mini EVK by onnetwork commissioning way, you should use to the [enable command](#enable-the-secure-storage-service) to enable the secure storage service.

## Running Matter OTA of Wi-Fi/BT firmware and application on the i.MX MPU platform

Matter provides chip-ota-provider-app and chip-ota-requestor-app to support the OTA update feature. On i.MX MPU platform, we provide a reference for 88W8987, IW612 firmware and nxp-thermostat-app OTA update. The network topology diagram as shown below.

<img src="../images/matter_demos/ota.png" width = "500"/>

Figure i.MX Network Topology Diagram for OTA

To perform OTA, two devices must be connected to the same Wi-Fi AP or connect to the same local area network. You can connect the two i.MX devices to a Wi-Fi AP using the following commands, or connect the two i.MX devices to the same local area network using network cables.

    $ wpa_passphrase ${SSID} ${PASSWORD} > wifiap.conf

    $ modprobe moal mod_para=nxp/wifi_mod_para.conf
    $ wpa_supplicant -d -B -i mlan0 -c ./wifiap.conf

Run the following commands on the i.MX ota requestor device to start the ota request.

    # OTA request for the 88W8987 firmware
    $ sudo /usr/bin/ota.sh -o 8987 -d 18

    # OTA request for the IW612 firmware
    $ sudo /usr/bin/ota.sh -o IW612 -d 18

    # OTA request for the nxp-thermostat-app firmware
    $ sudo /usr/bin/ota.sh -o nxp-thermostat-app -d 18

Then, copy the ota file to i.MX ota provider device, and run the following commands to start ota update to the i.MX ota requestor device.

    $ chip-ota-provider-app --discriminator 22 --secured-device-port 5565 --KVS /tmp/chip_kvs_provider --filepath ${ota_file_path}/${ota_file} &
    $ chip-tool pairing onnetwork-long 0xDEADBEEF 20202021 22
    $ chip-tool pairing onnetwork-long 0x1234567890 20202021 18
    $ chip-tool accesscontrol write acl '[{"fabricIndex": 1, "privilege": 5, "authMode": 2, "subjects": [112233], "targets": null}, {"fabricIndex": 1, "privilege": 3, "authMode": 2, "subjects": null, "targets": null}]' 0xDEADBEEF 0
    $ chip-tool otasoftwareupdaterequestor announce-otaprovider 0xDEADBEEF 0 0 0 0x1234567890 0

If the ota update is successful, for firmware ota, the i.MX ota requestor device will display the log "OTA update FW succeeded, Please reboot the i.MX device and re-setup the Wi-Fi and BT.", you should reboot the device and then reload the WiFi firmware and driver. For nxp-thermostat-app ota, the i.MX ota requestor device will display the log "OTA update nxp-thermostat-app succeeded.", you can start using the updated nxp-thermostat-app without any further intervention.

## FAQ

### Why chip-tool failed to control cluster after reboot?

Why does chip-tool fail to control the cluster after a reboot? This is because the default storage location of chip-tool on the Yocto operating system is in the `/tmp` directory, which is a temporary file system (tempfs) that is reset during power cycles. This can result in the loss of pairing information between the controller and the cluster, which includes applications such as chip-lighting-app, nxp-thermostat-app, chip-bridge-app, and more. To preserve this pairing information, it is critical to store the information in a persistent location. The recommended solution is to set the `TMPDIR` environment variable to a persistent location, such as `/etc`, before using chip-tool. This simple step can help ensure that the pairing information is stored in a directory that persists after a reboot, allowing you to avoid having to re-pair your devices after a reboot. Here are the detailed steps to set the `TMPDIR` environment variable in `/etc`:

Step 1. Export the `TMPDIR` environment variable to a persistent location on the controller device before using the chip-tool. This will preserve the pairing information with the cluster after a reboot. For example, `/etc` is one of the option locations to store these configuration files:

    $ export TMPDIR=/etc/

Step 2. Run the cluster application on end device

    # open the cluster application on the end device
    $ nxp-thermostat-app

Step 3. Use the controller to pair and control the desired application on the cluster end device using any pairing mode (onnetwork/ble-wifi). For example, run the following command to pair with and control the NXP thermostat app:

    # pairing the cluster on the controller device
    $ chip-tool pairing onnetwork 8888 20202021
    # control the cluster on the controller device
    $ chip-tool thermostat read local-temperature 8888 1

Note that the cluster application and pairing type can be selected to suit your needs.

Step 4. Then reboot the controller device while keeping the cluster device powered on.

Step 5. After rebooting the controller device, re-export the `TMPDIR` environment variable to the same location used in step 1:

    $ export TMPDIR=/etc/

Step 6. Use the chip-tool command again on the controller device to control the cluster device without having to repeat the pairing process.

    $ chip-tool thermostat read local-temperature 8888 1
